# EXERCICE 1
```{r}
# Generate the numbers 1, 2,. . ., 12,
# and store the result in the vector x

x <- 1:12
print(x)
```

# EXERCICE 2
```{r}
# Generate four repetitions of the sequence of numbers (6, 2, 4).

y <- rep(c(6, 2, 4), 4)
print(y)
```

# EXERCICE 3
```{r}
# Generate the sequence consisting of six 9s, then five 2s, and finally four
# 5s. Store the numbers in a 5 by 3 matrix (populating it columnwise).

# a normal distribution. Use the value 100 as seed (in order to be able
